Qst: Consider the bank accounts discussed in exercise 9 again.
        Now assume that each type of bank account is associated
        with a minimum balance as given in the table below:

        ********************************
	    Account		Minimum Balance
	    ********************************
	    A		            250
	    B		            1000
	    C		            250
	    X		            5000
	    ********************************

	    Adapt the switch statement of the program in exercise 9 above
	    so that the interest is applied only if the amount entered
	    satisfies the minimum balance requirement for the given account
	    otherwise an error message should be displayed.
