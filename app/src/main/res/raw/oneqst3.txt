Qst: Write a method that takes a number between 0 and 9 as
        an argument and prints on the screen "Number green bottles
        standing on the wall"(where Number is replaced by the word
        version of the number). If the numeric parameter is 1 then
        your method should print bottle rather than bottles.
        Remember to include the appropriate assertions.
