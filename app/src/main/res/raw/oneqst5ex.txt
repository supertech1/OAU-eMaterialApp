//Scanner class is a class in the java library and you can use this class to read data from input streams such as the console window and files.
//it contains methods for reading values of different datatype...e.g nextInt() for reading an int value, nextDouble() for reading a double value(i.e a floating point value)
//nextLine() to read the entire line....e.t.c.
