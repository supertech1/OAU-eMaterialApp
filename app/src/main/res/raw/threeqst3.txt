Qst: Using a for loop, write a program that displays a "6 times" 
        multiplication table; the output should look like this: 
        1 X 6 = 6
        2 X 6 = 12
        3 X 6 = 18
        4 X 6 = 24
        5 X 6 = 30
        6 X 6 = 36
        7 X 6 = 42
        8 X 6 = 48
        9 X 6 = 54
        10 X 6 = 60
        11 X 6 = 66
        12 X 6 = 72
	    Adapt the program so that instead of a "6 times" table, the 
	    user chooses which table is displayed.
