Qst: Consider a vending machine that offers the following options:
        [1] Get gum
        [2] Get chocolate
        [3] Get Juice
        [4] Get popcorn
        [5] Display total sold so far
        [6] Quit
     
        Design and implement a program that continuously allows users
        to select from these options. When options 1-4 are selected an
        appropriate message is to be displayed acknowledging their choice.
        For example, when option 3 is selected the following message could 
        be displayed: "Here  is your popcorn"
        When option 6 is chosen the program terminates. If an option other 
        than 1-6 is entered an appropriate error message should be displayed 
        such as: Error, options 1 - 6 only!
