What will be the output of the program?

		int x = 3, y = 1;
		if(x = y)   System.out.println("x = " + x);

A. x = 1	B.  x = 3	C.  Compilation error		D. Code runs with no output

		    Solution :

The 'if statement' condition must be a boolean expression. Therefore,
using an assignment operator as the condition results to a compilation error.

		    Ans: C
