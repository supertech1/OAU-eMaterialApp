What will be the output of this snippet?
	int x = 1, y = 10;
	while(x<y)
	{
		x+=2 * x;
		y = y – 1;
	}
	System.out.println(x);
	} }
	A.  6	B.  7	C.  1	D.  9

	Solution :
	int x = 1, y = 10;  //declaration and initialization of variable x and y
	while(x<y) //NB: this while loop will continue iterating until the value of x is lesser than that of y
	{
		x+=2 * x;  //add the result of the expression to the right to the current of value of x
		y = y – 1;  //assign variable y the result of the expression to the right.
		//Hint : This while loop will only iterate twice. On the first iteration, x = 3 and y = 9, and on second //iteration, x = 9, y = 8. At this point, the loop will stop since x is now greater than y.	
}
	System.out.println(x); //display the current value of x
	} }
	
	Ans : D
