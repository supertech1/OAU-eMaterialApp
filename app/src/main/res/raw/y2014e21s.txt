Answer : B

Explanation :
	
boolean a = false, b = false;   //declaration and initialization of boolean variables a and b
if(a)  //NB: the test condition here returns false since variable 'a' was initialized to false. Therefore, the following statement will not execute.
  System.out.println("A"); 
else if(a && b)  //NB: the test condition here returns false as well since variable a and b are both false
		System.out.println("A && B");
	else  //NB: java will read this else part since the test condition in 'if' above returns false
	{	
		if(!b)  //NB: !b returns true since b is false. Therefore, java executes the following statement
			System.out.println("notB");  //Display 'notB' on the console window
		else  //NB: java will not execute this else part since the test condition in 'if' above evaluated to true
			System.out.println("OK");
	}
