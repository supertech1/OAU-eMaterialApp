int i = 1, j = 8;  //declaration and initialization of integer variable i and j. 
		
do
		
{
			
	if(i < j) j--; //NB: this statement will always run provided i is lesser than j
		
}
while (i++ < 5);  //Note the effect of post-increment operator here.
		
System.out.println("i = " + i + "and j = " + j); //display the result
