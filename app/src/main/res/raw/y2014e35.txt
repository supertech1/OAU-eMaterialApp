What is the output of this program snippet?
	A. 0	B. 1	C. 3	D. -4
	int x = 3, y = -11%2, z;
	if(x > y)
		z = x;
	else
		z = y;
	System.out.print(z);
	
	Solution :

	int x = 3, y = -11%2, z; //declaration of variable integer variables x, y and z…Here, x is assigned 3, y is assigned -1 and z has no value yet
	if(x > y)  //The test condition here is true
		z = x;  //therefore, z is now 3 
	else
		z = y;
	System.out.print(z); /display the value of variable z
