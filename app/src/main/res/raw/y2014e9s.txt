Answer : A

Explanation :

Java defines several type promotion rules that apply to expressions.
They are as follows: First, all byte, short,and char values are promoted
to int, as just described. Then, if one operand is a long, the whole
expression is promoted to long. If one operand is a float, the entire
expression is promoted to float. If any of the operands are double, the
result is double
