Solution :
Data encapsulation, also known as data hiding, is the mechanism whereby the implementation details of a class are kept hidden from the user. The user can only perform a restricted set of operations on the hidden members of the class by executing special functions commonly called method. It is an Object Oriented Programming concept that binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data, and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as single unit. In encapsulation the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class, therefore it is also known as data hiding. One of the ways in achieving data encapsulation in java is by declaring the variables of a class as private and providing public setter and getter methods to modify and obtain the variables values.
