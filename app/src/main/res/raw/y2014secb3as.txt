Solution :

An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program and disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. Exceptions in file operation are those errors that occur when reading from or writing to a file. For example, using FileReader class in a program to read data from a file when the file specified in the constructor doesn't exist results to a FileNotFoundException.
