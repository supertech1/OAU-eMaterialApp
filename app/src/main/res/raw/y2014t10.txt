What is the output of this program?

class  Output
{
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		int  x, y; 
		x = 10;
		x++;
		--x;
		y= x++;
		System.out.println(x + " " +y);
	}
}
	
A.  11  11	B.  10  10	C.  11  10	D.  10  11


            Solution :

class  Output
{
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		int  x, y;  //declaration of variable x and y

		x = 10;     //initialize x to 10

		x++;        //using post-increment operator, increase x by 1 (NB: on this line, x is still 10)
			        //On this line x is now 11.

		--x;        //using pre-decrement operator, decrease x by 1  ( NB: x is now back to 10 on this line)

		y= x++;     //assign x to y, then increment x by 1 (This is an effect of post-increment operator)
		            // (NB: on executing the above line, the current value of x is assigned to y thereafter 
			        //incrementing x by 1. Therefore y = 10, x = 11

		System.out.println(x + " " +y);  //Display the result
	}
}
			
				
            Ans: C
