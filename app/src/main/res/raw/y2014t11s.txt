Answer : D

Explanation :

class  Output
{
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		int  a = 1;   //declaration and initialization of integer variable 'a' to 1

		int  b = 2;  //declaration and initialization of integer variable 'b' to 2

		int c;  //declaration of integer variable 'c'. (NB: Default value of an integer is 0)

		int d; //  declaration of integer variable 'd'.

		c = ++b;  //pre-increment variable 'b' and assign its new value to variable 'c'. (Therefore, b = 3, c = 3)

		d = a++;  //assign the current value of variable 'a' to variable 'd' and then increment variable 'a' by 1(Now d = 1, a = 2)

		c++;  //post-increment 'c' (Now c = 4)

		b++; //post-increment 'b' (Now b = 4)

		++a; //pre-increment a (Now a = 3)

		System.out.println(a + " " + b + " " + c);  //display the current value in  variables 'a', 'b' and 'c'
	}
}
