Which one is a valid declaration of a Boolean?

A. boolean  b1 = 1;	B.  boolean b2 = 'false';
C.  boolean b3 = false;	D. boolean b4 = 'true'


            Solution:

A is not valid because a numeric value can't be assigned to a boolean variable

B is not valid because boolean literals(i.e true and false) are not to be quoted

D is not valid because boolean literals(i.e true and false) are not to be quoted

            Ans: C
