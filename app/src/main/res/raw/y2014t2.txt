Qst 2. Which of the following operators can operate on a Boolean variable?
	1. &&  2. ==  3. +  4.  +=
	
	A. 3 & 2     B. 1 & 2	  C. 1,2 & 4	 D. 1,2, & 3


			Solution:

Arithmetic operators in Java are operators used with numeric type operands. 
That is, both operands to arithmetic operators must be one of types byte, short, 
char, int, long, float, and double. These operators cannot have operands of 
boolean primitive type and reference type. Examples of these arithmetic operators 
are: +, - ,+=, -= , * , / , % e.t.c. Also, we have Boolean logical operators  which
are used with boolean operand(s). Examples of boolean logical operators are:
&&, ==, ! , || e.t.c . Therefore, only option 1 and 2 can operate on Boolean variable.


			Ans: B
