Answer : D

Explanation :

class variable_scope
{
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		int x; x = 5;  //integer variable 'x' being declared and assigned a value of 5.
    			        //variable 'x' is only visible here in the main method block, thus, it will be accessible
	    		       //inside the following inner block.

		{
		    //NB: variable 'x' is still withing its scope..i.e, it is visible in this block
			int y = 6; //integer variable 'y'...assigned 6
				      //NB: variable 'y' is only visible and accessible in this inner block
				      //This implies that accessing variable 'y' outside this block will lead
				      //to a compilation error

			System.out.print(x + " " + y); //display the value of x and y.
		}

        //NB: variable 'y' is no longer visible and accessible here

		System.out.println(x + " " + y); //Now we are accessing variable 'y' which is no longer visible
		                                 //and accessible.Therefore, compiling this code results to a compilation error
	}
}
