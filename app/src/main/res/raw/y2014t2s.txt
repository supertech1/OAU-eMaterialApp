Answer: B

Explanation : 

Arithmetic operators in Java are operators used with numeric 
type operands. That is, both operands to arithmetic operators
must be one of types byte, short, char, int, long, float, and
double. These operators cannot have operands of boolean 
primitive type and reference type. Examples of these arithmetic
operators are: +, - ,+=, -= , * , / , % e.t.c. Also, we have 
Boolean logical operators  which are used with boolean operand(s).
Examples of boolean logical operators are: &&, ==, ! , || e.t.c . 
Therefore, only option 1 and 2 can operate on Boolean variable.
