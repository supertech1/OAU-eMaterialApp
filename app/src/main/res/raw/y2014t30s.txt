Answer : B

Explanation :

class Cond
{
	public static void main( String args[])
	{
		int i = 20, j = 55,  z = 0;  //declaration and initialization of integer variables 'i', 'j' and 'z'

		if( i < j)  z = i;    //check whether 'i' is lesser than 'j'...NB: since 'i' is lesser than 'j', the value
					         //in variable 'i' will be assigned to variable 'z'...therefore, the else part will be skipped
		else  z = j - i;
	
		System.out.println(z);  //display the value in variable 'z'
	}
}
