Which of the following are legal lines of java code?

i.   int w =  (int) 888.8;
ii.  byte x  = (byte)  100L;
iii. long  y  = (byte) 100;
iv.  byte  z =  (byte) 100L;

A.   i and ii 	B.  ii and iii	C.  iii and iv	D.   All statements are correct

            Solution:

(i) is correct because when a floating-point number (a double in this case) is cast to an int,

it simply loses the digits after the decimal.

(ii) and (iv) are correct. It is possible and valid to cast a long value to a byte value. If the long value is over 127,

it loses its most significant (leftmost) bits.

(iii) actually works, even though a cast is not necessary, because it is valid to assign a byte value to a long variable.
