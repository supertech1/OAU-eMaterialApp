An expression involving byte, int, and literal numbers is promoted to which of these?

A. int 	B.  long	C.  byte	D. float

		
            Solution:

Java defines several type promotion rules that apply to expressions. 
They are as follows: First, all byte, short,and char values are 
promoted to int, as just described. Then, if one operand is a long, 
the whole expression is promoted to long. If one operand is a float,
the entire expression is promoted to float. If any of the operands are
double, the result is double

            Ans: A
