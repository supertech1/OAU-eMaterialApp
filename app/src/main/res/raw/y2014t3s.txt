Answer: D
 
Explanation : 

Boolean Logical Operators are operators that operate on one
or two operand. Unary Operators are those that operate on one
operand e.g Logical Not ( ! ) while Binary Operators are those
that operate on two operands (left and right operand) e.g 
Short-circuit AND (&&), Logical AND (&),Short-circuit OR(||),
Logical OR( | ) e.t.c. Logical  And(&) and Short-circuit AND (&&),
both returns true if both  operands are true.If either operand is 
false, they return false. (&&) is called a short-circuit AND operator
because if operand1 (the left-hand operand) evaluate to false, it 
returns false without evaluating operand2 (the right-hand operand) 
which makes it different from (&) which evaluates both operand 
irrespective of whether the left operand is false or true.
