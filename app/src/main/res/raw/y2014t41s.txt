Answer : B

Explanation :

Type casting a larger variable into a smaller variable results in modulo of

larger variable by range of smaller variable. Variables 'a' and 'b' contains

 295.04 and  300 which are larger than byte's range i:e -128 to 127 hence,

variable 'c'  contains 295 modulo 256  i.e 39 and variable 'd' contains

300 modulo 256 i:e 44.
