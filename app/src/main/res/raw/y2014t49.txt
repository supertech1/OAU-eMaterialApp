Which of these is an incorrect array declaration?

A.  int arr[] = new int[5]    B.   int [] arr = new int[5]    

C.  int arr[]; arr = new int[5]    D.   int arr[] = int[5] new

	
		Solution :

On memory allocation to an array variable, operator new must precede

the array type and size. Therefore, option D is an incorrect way of

declaring an array.

		
		Ans :  D
