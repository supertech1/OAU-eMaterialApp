Answer:  D

Explanation : Relational operators are binary operators 
(i.e they take two operands). The result produced by a 
relational operator is always a Boolean value true or 
false. Examples are : Greater than( >), Less than(<), 
Equal to(==), Not Equal to(!=) e.t.c.The expression 
inside the println() method is a boolean expression 
due to the Greater than(>) operator used. Hence, since 
v1( initialized to 5) is not greater than v2(initialized to 6).
Therefore, the output of the expression will be false.
