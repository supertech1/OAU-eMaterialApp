What value is stored in variable n at the end of this looping? 
for( int n = 0; n < 5; n++)
	
A. 0	B.  4	C.   5	D.  6

	
	Solution :

The test condition will return false when variable 'n' is greater than
or equals to 5. At the point variable 'n' is initialized to 5, the test
condition returns false, thus, terminating the loop.

	Ans : C
