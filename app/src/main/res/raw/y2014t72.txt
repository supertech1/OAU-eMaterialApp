Which of these is a selection statement in Java?
	
A. if( )  B. for ( )  C. continue  D. break

		Solution :

Java has three types of selection statements. The if statement 
either performs (selects) an action, if a condition is true, 
or skips it, if the condition is false. The if...else statement
performs an action if a condition is true and performs a different
action if the condition is false. The switch statement performs one
of many different actions,depending on the value of an expression. 
The if statement is a single-selection statement because it selects 
or ignores a single action (or, as we'll soon see, a single group of
actions). The if...else statement is called a double-selection statement
because it selects between two different actions (or groups of actions).
The switch statement is called a multiple-selection statement because it
selects among many different actions (or groups of actions).
