Which of the following loops will execute the body of loop even 
when condition controlling the loop is initially false?

A. do-while  B. while	C. for	D. None


	Solution:

for and while loop checks for the test condition before executing the
body of the loop; if the test condition  is false, the body never executes.
The do-while statement is similar but different from 'if and while'
statements because it checks the test condition after executing the loop's
body; therefore, the body always executes at least once.
