Answer: C

Explanation :

Class increment    
{ 
	public static void main(String args[])  
	{
		double var1 = 1 + 5;  	   //var1 equals 6.0 after evaluation
		double var2 = var1/4;	   //Here  var2 =  6 .0/ 4 since var1 is  6.0.
   					   // After evaluation, var2 = 1.5, since
					   //var2  is of double data type which support decimals.
		int var3 = 1 + 5;	   // Var3 equals 6 after evaluation
		int var4 = var3 / 4;	   //Here  var4 =  6 / 4 since var3 is 6. After evaluation, var4 = 1, since
  					   // var4 is of int data type which does not support decimals...hence
  					   // the decimal part is truncated.
		System.out.println(var2 + " "+ var4);   // NB: + here is used to concatenate variables value
 					   //2geda with string. Hence, it is not used as an arithmetic
					   //operator.
	}
}
