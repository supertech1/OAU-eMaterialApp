Answer: C

Explanation :
	
class increment
{
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		int   g =3;                 //variable g of data type 'int'...initialized to 3

		System.out.print(++g * 8);  //pre-increment(++) operator increases its operand by 1 before using
		                            //the operand value. Thus, incrementing g by 1 before using it...therfore,
		                            //the line can be read as : 'display the result of 4 * 8'
	}
}
