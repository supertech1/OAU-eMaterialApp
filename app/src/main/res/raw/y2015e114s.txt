Ans : B

Explanation :

Constructors are not inherited, however, a superclass's constructors are still available
to subclasses. In fact, the first task of any subclass constructor is to call its direct 
superclass's constructor, either explicitly or implicitly (if no constructor call is specified),
to ensure that the instance variables inherited from the superclass are initialized properly.
