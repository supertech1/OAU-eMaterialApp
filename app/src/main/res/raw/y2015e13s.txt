Answer : C

Explanation :

finally creates a block of code that will be executed after a try /catch block has completed
and before the code following the try/catch block. The finally block will execute whether
or not an exception is thrown. If an exception is thrown, the finally block will execute even
if no catch statement matches the exception. Any time a method is about to return to the
caller from inside a try/catch block, via an uncaught exception or an explicit return
statement, the finally clause is also executed just before the method returns. This can be
useful for closing file handles and freeing up any other resources that might have been
allocated at the beginning of a method with the intent of disposing of them before
returning. The finally clause is optional. However, each try statement requires at least
one catch or a finally clause.
