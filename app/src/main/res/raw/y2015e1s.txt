Answer : D

Explanation:  

An Exception is an indication of a problem that occurs during a program's execution.
An exception is an unexpected or error condition. The programs you write can generate
many types of potential exceptions, such as when you do the following:
 * You issue a command to read a file from a disk, but the file does not exist there.
 * You attempt to write data to a disk, but the disk is full or unformatted.
 * Your program asks for user input, but the user enters invalid data.
 * The program attempts to divide a value by 0.
 * The program tries to access an array with a subscript that is too large or too small.

These errors are called exceptions because, presumably, they are not usual occurrences;
they are -exceptional.
