Explanation :

To create your own throwable Exception, you must extend a subclass of Throwable. Recall that 
Throwable has two subclasses, Exception and Error, which are used to distinguish between recoverable
and nonrecoverable errors. Because you always want to create your own Exceptions for recoverable errors, 
you should extend your Exceptions from the Exception class. You can extend any existing Exception subclass,
such as ArithmeticException or NullPointerException, but usually you want to inherit directly from Exception.
