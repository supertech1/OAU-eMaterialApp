Explanation :

A Boolean variable can either be true or false and since we can answer the question : "Is it raining?"
with either true or false, then a suitable data type to record such is Boolean. 

For Example,

boolean rain_status = true;

The interpreatation of the above statement is simply that rain is falling since rain_status = true. 
You can as well set rain_status to false by simply writing:

rain_status = false;
