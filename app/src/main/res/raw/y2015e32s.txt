Explanation :

Operator precedence refers to the rules for the order in which parts of a mathematical
expression are evaluated. The multiplication, division, and remainder operators have the
same precedence. Their precedence is higher than that for the addition and subtraction
operators. Addition and subtraction have the same precedence. In other words,
multiplication, division, and remainder always take place from left to right prior to addition or
subtraction in an expression. Also, Everything to the right of the assignment operator is always 
evaluated before the assignment is performed.
