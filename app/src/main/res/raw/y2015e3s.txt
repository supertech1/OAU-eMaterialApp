Answer: B

Explanation :

Class Throwable has only two direct subclasses which are Exception and Error. 
Class Exception and its subclasses' for instance, RuntimeException (package java.lang)
and IOException (package java.io) - represent exceptional situations that can occur in a
Java program and that can be caught by the application while on the other hand, Class Error 
and its subclasses represent abnormal situations that happen in the JVM. Most Errors happen 
infrequently and should not be caught by applications because it's usually not possible for
applications to recover from Errors.Hence, Errors are more serious than Exceptions. 
The Error class represents more serious errors from which your program usually cannot recover. 
Usually, you do not use or implement Error objects in your programs. A program cannot recover 
from Error conditions on its own.

The Exception class comprises less serious errors that represent unusual conditions that
arise while a program is running and from which the program can recover
