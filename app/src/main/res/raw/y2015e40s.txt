Explanation :

The package that is implicitly imported into every Java program is named java.lang. The
classes it contains are fundamental classes, or basic classes, as opposed to the optional
classes that must be explicitly named. Some references list a few other Java classes as also
being "fundamental" but the java.lang package is the only automatically imported, named
package.
