Explanation: 

Java is a case sensitive language. As an illustration, let us define two String variables
to hold the firstname of a student.

	String FirstNAME = "tola"
	String firstname = "seun"

The above two String variables name (FirstNAME and firstname) are not considered the 
same due to the fact that one is  a mixture of capital letters small letters while the other 
is in lower case all through. Because java is case sensitive, we say both variable names are not the same.
