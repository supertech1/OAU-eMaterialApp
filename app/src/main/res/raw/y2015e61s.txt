Explanation :

System.out contains 3 methods which are used to display output in the command window. 
The 3 methods are : print(), println() and printf().

Method System.out.println displays (or prints) a line of text in the command
window. When System.out.println completes its task, it positions the output cursor (the location where
the next character will be displayed) at the beginning of the next line in the command.

Also, Method System.out.print displays (or prints) a line of text in the command
Window but unlike System.out.println , it does not positions the output cursor  at 
the beginning of the nextline, instead, the output cursor is immediately after the last character.

And lastly, method System.out.printf display a formatted output in the command window.
