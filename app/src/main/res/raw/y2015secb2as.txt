Solution :

if statement is a selection statement. An if statement checks if an expression is true or false, and then
runs the code inside the statement only if it is true. On the other hand, While statement is a repetition statement.
A while statement is a loop. Basically, it continues to execute the code in the while statement for however long the
expression is true.
