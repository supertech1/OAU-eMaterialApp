Consider the following program, which uses the StockItem class, and in which some of the code has been replaced by comments:

Import java.util.*;
public class TestProg {
	Public static void main(String [] args){
	Scanner keyboard = new scanner (System.in);
	String tempNumber;
	String tempName;
	Double tempPrice;
	System.out.print("Enter the stock number : ");
	tempNumber = keyboardString.nextLine();
	System.out.print("Enter the name of the itme : ");
	tempNumber = keyboardString.nextLine();
	System.out.print("Enter the price of the item: ");
	tempNumber = keyboard.nextDouble();
	
	//Create a new item of stock using the values that were entered by the user
	//increase the total number of items in stock by 5
	//Display the stock number;
	//Display the total price of all items in stock
	}
}

ii. Replace the comments with appropriate code
iii. A further attribute, salesTax, is required.The value of this attribute should always be the same for each object of the class. Write the declaration for this attribute.
iv. Provide a class method, setSalesTax, for this class - it should receive a double and set the value of the sales tax to this value.
