Ans : A

Explanation : 

The program will not compile because the expression ((firstvar + secondvar)/2.0;) on line 4 gives a double
as result which is not compatible with the data type of the float variable (ave) we want to assign the result to. 
For the program to compile, all you need to do is to cast the result to double which can be done as follows:   
firstvar = 6.0; secondvar = 8.0; ave = (float)((firstvar + secondvar)/2.0);

The code will compile and run fine if replace  line 4 with the above statement.
