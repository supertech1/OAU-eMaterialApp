Explanation :

In a class, there can be several methods with the same name. However they must have a different signature. 
The signature of a method is comprised of its name, its argument/parameter types and the order of its 
arguments/parameters. The signature of a method is not comprised of its return type nor its visibility
nor the exceptions it may throw. The practice of defining two or more methods within the same class that
share the same name but have different parameters is called overloading methods.
