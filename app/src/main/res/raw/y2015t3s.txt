MACHINE LANGUAGE: is the sequence of 0s (Zero's) and 1s (One's)  used to write a sequence of instructions for
the computer to execute. It is also referred to as instructions written in binary format. 
This makes it the closest to the computer  hardware.

ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE uses mnemonic or symbols to write instructions for the computer to execute. 
It requires an assembler to translate its symbols to machine code.

Objected oriented programming is a programming language that enables a programmer to write programs that 
are more or less independent of a particular type of computer. They are languages that shields programmers
from the responsibility of having to manage explicitly all the computer features of data storage and operations. 
Management of these computer features is handled by the operating system. It requires a compiler or interpreter
to convert its code to machine code
