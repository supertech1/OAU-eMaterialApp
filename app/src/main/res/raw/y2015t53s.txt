Ans : B

Explanation :

When performing calculations in java, java checks the data type of both the lef operand and 
the right operand to determine the result data type. If If any of the operand is a double, 
the result would be a double, if both are numeric type(byte or short or int or long), the 
result would be an int. In the code given, both operands are ints(1 and 5) , so, you should 
expect the result data type to be an int....normally the result is 0.2 but since java would 
return an int, the .2 got truncated in the process.
