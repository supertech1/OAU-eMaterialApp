Explanation :

Programming platform is the underlying hardware or software for a system. For example, the platform might
be an Intel 80486 processor running DOS Version 6.0. The platform could also be UNIX machines on an Ethernet network.
The platform defines a standard around which a system can be developed. Once the platform has been defined, software
 developers can produce appropriate software and managers can purchase appropriate hardware and applications. 
The term is often used as a synonym of operating system.
