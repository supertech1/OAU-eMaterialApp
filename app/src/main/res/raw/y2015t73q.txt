Analyze the following statement:

double sum = 0;
for(double d = 0; d < 10;){
d += 0.1;
sum += sum + d;
}


A. the program has a compile error because the adjustment is missing in the for loop
B. the program has a compile error because the control variable in the for loop cannot be of the double data type
C. the program compiles and runs fine
D. the program has a compile error because the adjustment is missing in the for loop
E. the program runs in an infinite loop because d < 10 would always be true.
